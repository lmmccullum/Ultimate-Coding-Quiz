                        THE ULTIMATE CODING QUIZ

DESCRIPTION:

    Yay! I've created my first quiz. This is a timed coding quiz that includes 
    
multiple-choice questions. I've decided to name it 'The Ultimate Quiz'. This   

app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by 

JavaScript/Jquery code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and 

be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

INSTRUCTIONS:

    Start by clicking the 'Start Quiz' button to display a series of questions.

Once the quiz begins, a 60 seconds countdown timer starts. If a question is answered 

incorrectly, there will be a penalty in which 10 seconds is 

deducted from the timer. The timer ends when all questions have been answered or the 

timer reaches 0. After the game ends, the user can save their initials and their score 

will appear in the highscores page.
